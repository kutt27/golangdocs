# Go IO Package

The `io` package provides the fundamental building blocks for working with data streams. Almost everything in Go that reads or writes data (files, network connections, buffers) uses the interfaces defined here.

### 1. Core Interfaces

There are two primary interfaces you will see everywhere:

-   **`Reader`**: Anything that has a `Read(p []byte)` method. It fills the slice `p` with data.
-   **`Writer`**: Anything that has a `Write(p []byte)` method. It sends data from the slice `p` to a destination (like a file).

```go
package main

import (
    "io"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    // 1. A Reader (strings.Reader)
    r := strings.NewReader("some data\n")

    // 2. A Writer (os.Stdout)
    w := os.Stdout

    // 3. io.Copy connects them together
    io.Copy(w, r)
}
```

### 2. Common Utility Functions

-   **`io.Copy(dst, src)`**: Read everything from `src` and write it to `dst` until EOF.
-   **`io.ReadAll(r)`**: Reads everything from a reader into a single `[]byte`.
-   **`io.WriteString(w, s)`**: A convenience function to write a string directly to a writer.

### 3. Combining Streams

-   **`io.MultiReader(r1, r2, ...)`**: Combines multiple readers into one big reader that reads them in order.
-   **`io.MultiWriter(w1, w2, ...)`**: A single writer that duplicates every write to multiple destinations (useful for logging to both terminal and file).
-   **`io.LimitReader(r, n)`**: Reads at most `n` bytes from `r`.
-   **`io.TeeReader(r, w)`**: Returns a reader that writes everything it reads to `w` (like the Unix `tee` command).

### Why use `io` interfaces?

1.  **Flexibility**: You can write a function that takes an `io.Reader`, and it will work with files, HTTP bodies, ZIP archives, or plain strings without any changes.
2.  **Efficiency**: By using streams instead of loading everything into memory at once, your program can process gigabytes of data using only a few kilobytes of RAM.
3.  **Standardization**: Because the whole Go ecosystem uses these interfaces, libraries usually "just work" together.
