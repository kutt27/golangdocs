# Temporary Files and Embedding

This guide covers two important file-system concepts: working with temporary data and embedding static files into your Go binary.

### 1. Temporary Files and Directories

Sometimes you need a file just for a few seconds (e.g., to process an upload). Use `os.CreateTemp` to create a file in the OS's temporary folder with a unique name.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // 1. Create a temporary file
    // The "" means use the default temporary directory
    f, _ := os.CreateTemp("", "sample-*.txt")
    
    // 2. Clean up when finished
    defer os.Remove(f.Name())

    fmt.Println("Temp file name:", f.Name())

    // 3. Create a temporary directory
    d, _ := os.MkdirTemp("", "sampledir-*")
    defer os.RemoveAll(d)
}
```

### 2. The `embed` Directive

Introduced in Go 1.16, the `//go:embed` directive allows you to pack static files (like HTML or images) directly into your compiled `.exe` or binary file. This makes deployment much easier because you only have one file to share.

```go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "fmt"
)

// 1. Tell Go which file to embed
//go:embed folder/version.txt
var version string

// 2. You can also embed a whole folder
//go:embed static/*
var staticFiles embed.FS

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Version:", version)

    // Read a file from the embedded folder
    data, _ := staticFiles.ReadFile("static/logo.png")
    fmt.Println("Logo size:", len(data))
}
```

### Why use Embedding?

1.  **Single Binary**: No more "file not found" errors on production servers. All your CSS, JS, and templates are inside the program.
2.  **Security**: Embedded files are read-only, preventing them from being tampered with at runtime.
3.  **Speed**: Accessing data from memory is faster than reading from a spinning disk or SSD.
