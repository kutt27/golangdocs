# Go Directories

Working with directories is a core part of many Go applications. You'll primarily use the `os` package for these tasks.

### 1. Basic Operations

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // 1. Create a single directory
    err := os.Mkdir("subdir", 0755)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }

    // 2. Create nested directories (like `mkdir -p`)
    err = os.MkdirAll("a/b/c", 0755)

    // 3. Remove a directory (must be empty)
    os.Remove("subdir")

    // 4. Remove a directory and all its contents (like `rm -rf`)
    os.RemoveAll("a")
}
```

### 2. Listing Directory Contents

Use `os.ReadDir` to get a list of files and folders inside a directory.

```go
entries, _ := os.ReadDir(".")

for _, entry := range entries {
    fmt.Println(entry.Name(), entry.IsDir())
}
```

### 3. Change Working Directory

You can change where your program searches for files using `Chdir`.

```go
os.Chdir("/tmp")
cwd, _ := os.Getwd()
fmt.Println("Current dir:", cwd)
```

### Linux Permission Codes (The `0755`)

When creating directories or files, Go uses numeric permission codes (octal).

| Code | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `0755` | Everyone can read/execute; only owner can write. (Standard for folders) |
| `0644` | Everyone can read; only owner can write. (Standard for files) |
| `0700` | Only the owner can do anything. (Private) |
| `0777` | Everyone can do everything. (**Not recommended**) |

### Why use `MkdirAll`?
It is "idempotent." If the directory already exists, it doesn't return an error; it just does nothing. This makes it safer for setup scripts.
