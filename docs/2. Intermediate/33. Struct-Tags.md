# Go Struct Tags

Struct tags are small strings of metadata attached to fields. They are used by other packages (like `json`, `xml`, or database drivers) to decide how to handle your data.

### Syntax

Tags are placed in backticks after the type of a field.

```go
type User struct {
    Name  string `json:"user_name" db:"customer_name"`
    Age   int    `json:"age" val:"min=18"`
    Email string `json:"-"` // This field is ignored by the JSON package
}
```

### How they work

The Go compiler ignores struct tags. However, other code can read them at runtime using **Reflection**.

### Common Examples

1.  **JSON**: `json:"id,omitempty"` (Change name, skip if empty).
2.  **Databases (GORM/SQL)**: `db:"user_id"` (Map field to specific column name).
3.  **Validation**: `validate:"required,email"` (Used by libraries to check input data).
4.  **XML**: `xml:"token,attr"` (Map field to an XML attribute instead of a tag).

### Why use Struct Tags?

1.  **Cleaner Code**: You don't have to write manual conversion logic for every field.
2.  **Flexibility**: You can have one struct that maps to a JSON API, a PostgreSQL database, and an XML file, all with different field names.
3.  **Declarative**: You "describe" how the data should behave rather than writing the step-by-step logic.
