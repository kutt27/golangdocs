# Go Pointers

A **pointer** is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a value (like `42`), it holds a location (like `0xc0000120b0`).

### Basic Syntax

-   `&`: The **"address of"** operator. It gives you the memory address of a variable.
-   `*`: The **"dereference"** operator. It allows you to access or change the value at the address a pointer is holding.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    i := 42
    p := &i // p points to i

    fmt.Println(p)  // Prints the memory address (e.g., 0xc0000120b0)
    fmt.Println(*p) // Prints the value at that address (42)

    *p = 21         // Changes the value of i through the pointer
    fmt.Println(i)  // Prints 21
}
```

### Why use Pointers?

1.  **Efficiency**: Passing a pointer to a large struct is much faster than copying the entire struct.
2.  **Modification**: If you want a function to modify a variable from the outside, you must pass a pointer.

### Comparison: Value vs Pointer

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// This function receives a COPY (value remains unchanged outside)
func zeroval(ival int) {
    ival = 0
}

// This function receives a POINTER (modifies the actual variable)
func zeroptr(iptr *int) {
    *iptr = 0
}

func main() {
    i := 1
    zeroval(i)
    fmt.Println(i) // 1

    zeroptr(&i)
    fmt.Println(i) // 0
}
```

### Important Notes

-   **Nil Pointers**: The "zero value" of a pointer is `nil`. Trying to dereference a `nil` pointer will cause a crash (panic).
-   **No Pointer Arithmetic**: Unlike C, Go does not allow you to add or subtract from pointers (e.g., `p++` is not allowed).
