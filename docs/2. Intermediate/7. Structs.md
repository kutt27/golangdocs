# Go Structs

A **struct** (short for "structure") is a collection of fields. It allows you to group different types of data into a single custom type.

### Defining a Struct

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// person struct has a Name and an Age
type person struct {
    name string
    age  int
}

func main() {
    // 1. Basic initialization
    fmt.Println(person{"Bob", 20})

    // 2. Named fields (recommended for clarity)
    p := person{name: "Alice", age: 30}
    fmt.Println(p.name)

    // 3. Pointers to structs
    sp := &p
    fmt.Println(sp.age)

    // 4. Modifying a field
    sp.age = 51
    fmt.Println(p.age) // Now 51
}
```

### Why use Structs?

-   **Organization**: Keep related data together (e.g., a `User` struct with `ID`, `Email`, and `Password`).
-   **Method Receivers**: You can attach functions (methods) to structs.
-   **JSON/Database Mapping**: Use "tags" to tell Go how to convert a struct to JSON or a database row.

### Struct Tags

Tags are small pieces of metadata added to fields, usually to help with JSON.

```go
type User struct {
    ID    int    `json:"id"`
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Email string `json:"email"`
}
```

### Important Notes

-   **Zero Values**: If you don't provide a value for a field, it gets its "zero value" (e.g., `0` for `int`, `""` for `string`).
-   **Exporting**: If a struct field starts with a **Capital Letter**, it is public (exported). If it starts with a **lowercase letter**, it is private to its package.
