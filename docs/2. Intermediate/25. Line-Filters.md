# Go Line Filters

A **line filter** is a common type of program that reads input from `stdin`, processes it line-by-line, and then prints a result to `stdout`. Examples include `grep` or `sed`.

### Basic Example: Uppercase Filter

This program reads text from `stdin`, converts it to uppercase, and prints it.

```go
package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "strings"
)

func main() {
    // 1. Create a scanner to read from standard input
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)

    for scanner.Scan() {
        // 2. Process each line
        ucl := strings.ToUpper(scanner.Text())

        // 3. Output the result
        fmt.Println(ucl)
    }

    // 4. Check for errors during scanning
    if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintln(os.Stderr, "error:", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}
```

### How to use it

You can use the pipe (`|`) operator in your terminal to feed data into your Go program:

```bash
# Compile the program
go build uppercase.go

# Pipe another command's output into it
echo "hello go" | ./uppercase
# Output: HELLO GO
```

### Common Filter Ideas

1.  **Grep**: Only print lines that contain a specific word.
2.  **Line Counter**: Add a number to the start of every line.
3.  **Search and Replace**: Replace every occurrence of "foo" with "bar".
4.  **Log Parser**: Extract only the timestamp and error message from a log file.

### Why use Line Filters?

1.  **Memory Efficiency**: By processing data line-by-line, your program can handle files that are much larger than the available RAM.
2.  **Composability**: You can chain multiple small filter programs together to solve complex tasks.
