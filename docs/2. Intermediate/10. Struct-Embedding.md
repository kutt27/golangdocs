# Go Struct Embedding

In Go, **embedding** is the way we achieve composition. It allows one struct to include another, giving it access to its fields and methods directly.

### Basic example

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type base struct {
    num int
}

func (b base) describe() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("base with num=%v", b.num)
}

type container struct {
    base // This is an embedded struct
    str  string
}

func main() {
    co := container{
        base: base{num: 1},
        str:  "some name",
    }

    // We can access fields of 'base' directly on 'co'
    fmt.Println("co.num:", co.num) // 1
    
    // We can also call methods of 'base' directly on 'co'
    fmt.Println("describe:", co.describe())
}
```

### Why use Embedding?

-   **Code Reuse**: Instead of copying fields or methods, you can group them into a base struct and embed it.
-   **Polymorphism through Interfaces**: If `base` implements an interface, `container` will also implement it automatically because it "inherits" the methods.

### Important Notes

-   **Shadowing**: If both structs have a field with the same name, the outer struct's field "shadows" the inner one. You can still access the inner one using the full path (e.g., `co.base.num`).
-   **Not Inheritance**: Even though it looks like inheritance, Go uses composition. The `base` struct doesn't know about the `container` struct.
