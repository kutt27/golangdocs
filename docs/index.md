# Welcome to Go Documentation

Go (or Golang) is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is designed to be **simple**, **reliable**, and **efficient**.

### Why Learn Go?

1.  **Simplicity**: Go has a very small set of keywords and a clean syntax, making it easy to learn and read.
2.  **Concurrency**: Built-in support for "Goroutines" and "Channels" makes it easy to write programs that do many things at once.
3.  **Fast**: Go compiles to native machine code, making it nearly as fast as C++.
4.  **Standard Library**: A massive built-in library for things like HTTP servers, JSON, and cryptography.
5.  **Modern**: Built-in garbage collection, memory safety, and excellent tooling (`gofmt`, `go test`).

### Where Go is Used

-   **Cloud Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform are all written in Go.
-   **Microservices**: Go's low memory footprint and fast startup times make it perfect for APIs.
-   **CLI Tools**: Fast compilation and static binaries make it ideal for command-line utilities.

### Getting Started

If you're new to Go, we recommend following the tutorials in order:

1.  **[Basics](./1.%20Basics/1.%20Hello-World.md)**: Variables, Loops, and Data Types.
2.  **[Intermediate](./2.%20Intermediate/3.%20Pointers.md)**: Structs, Interfaces, and Concurrency.
3.  **[Advanced](./3.%20Advanced/1.%20Goroutines.md)**: Complex patterns and system utilities.

*Happy Coding!*
