# Understanding the Go Compiler

!!! abstract "Overview"
    Discover how Go transforms your source code into executable programs through its powerful compiler toolchain. This guide extends our Hello World tutorial by diving deep into the compilation process.

!!! tip "Key Points"
    - Go is a compiled language
    - Source code → Machine code transformation
    - Multiple ways to build and run programs
    - Optimized for performance

## Revisit: Two Ways to Run Go Programs
=== "1. Build Then Run"
    ```bash
    #$ go build hello.go
    ./hello
    ```
    Perfect for production deployments

=== "2. Direct Execution"
    ```bash
    #$ go run hello.go
    ```
    Ideal for development

## Understanding the Compiler

!!! info "What is the Go Compiler?"
    The Go compiler transforms your source code into machine-executable programs through a sophisticated pipeline:

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[Source Code] --> B[Parsing]
        B --> C[Type Checking]
        C --> D[Optimization]
        D --> E[Code Generation]
        E --> F[Binary Executable]
        style A fill:#999,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:2px,color:#000
        style F fill:#999,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
    ```

    1. **Parsing**
        - Reads source code
        - Creates Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
    2. **Type Checking**
        - Verifies type correctness
        - Ensures type safety
    3. **Optimization**
        - Improves performance
        - Reduces code size
    4. **Code Generation**
        - Produces machine code
        - Target platform specific

One of the key insight here is that, go uses 'utf-8' encoding stream to convert our program from human readable code to machine readable code. I have written a blog post on this same topic on C. You can check it [here](https://amals27.hashnode.dev/deep-dive-into-hello-world). Though you will understand the entire low level operation on C which is based on ASCII. 

### Building with `go build`

!!! example "Basic Usage"
    ```bash title="Command Syntax"
    go build [options] [packages]
    ```

    === "Simple Build"
        ```bash
        go build hello.go
        ```

    === "Output Location"
        - 🐧 Linux/macOS: `hello`
        - 🪟 Windows: `hello.exe` ( windows binary executable is denoted by `.exe` extension )

### Running Your Program

!!! example "Executing the Binary"
    === "Linux/macOS"
        ```bash
        ./hello
        ```

    === "Windows"
        ```bash
        hello.exe
        ```

### Why Use `go build`?

!!! success "Key Benefits"
    1. **Performance**
        - Pre-compiled for speed
        - No runtime compilation
    
    2. **Distribution**
        - Share binaries, not source
        - Professional software delivery
    
    3. **Zero Delay**
        - No compilation at runtime
        - Instant startup
    
    4. **Self-Contained**
        - Statically linked by default
        - No external dependencies

### Cross-Platform Support

!!! tip "Build for Any Platform"
    ```bash title="Cross-Compilation Commands"
    # 🪟 Build for Windows
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build hello.go

    # 🍎 Build for macOS
    GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build hello.go

    # 🐧 Build for Linux
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build hello.go
    ```

    Build once, run anywhere!

## Quick Development with `go run`

!!! question "What is `go run`?"
    A powerful command that combines compilation and execution in one step - perfect for development!

### How it Works :gear:

!!! info "Behind the Scenes"
    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant D as Developer
        participant G as go run
        participant T as Temp Dir
        participant E as Executable
        D->>G: go run hello.go
        G->>T: 1. Create temp dir
        G->>T: 2. Compile program
        T->>E: 3. Create executable
        E->>D: 4. Run & show output
        G->>T: 5. Clean up
    ```

### Quick Start

    ```bash title="Command Syntax"
    go run [options] [go files] [arguments]
    ```

    === "Run Single File"
        ```bash
        go run hello.go
        ```
