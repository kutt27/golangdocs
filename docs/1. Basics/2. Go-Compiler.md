# The Go Compiler

Go is a **compiled language**. This means your source code is converted into machine code (binary) before it is executed.

### Two Ways to Run Go

| Command | Action | Best for... |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`go run`** | Compiles to a temp folder and runs immediately. | Development and testing. |
| **`go build`** | Compiles to a permanent executable binary. | Production and shipping apps. |

### Building for Production

When you run `go build`, Go creates a self-contained binary. This binary includes everything it needs to run—no need to install Go on the server!

```bash
# Creates a file named 'hello' (or 'hello.exe' on Windows)
go build hello.go

# Run the binary
./hello
```

### Cross-Compilation

One of Go's best features is the ability to build binaries for other operating systems from your current machine.

```bash
# Build for Windows (from Mac/Linux)
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build hello.go

# Build for Linux (from Windows/Mac)
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build hello.go
```

### Why is the Go Compiler special?

1.  **Fast**: Even large projects compile in seconds.
2.  **Static Binaries**: By default, Go binaries don't depend on external libraries (like `libc`).
3.  **Optimization**: The compiler automatically removes unused code (dead code elimination) to keep binaries small and fast.
