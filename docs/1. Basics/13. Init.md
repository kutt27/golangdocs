# The `init` Function in Go

This document provides a concise guide to the `init` function in Go. The `init` function is a special function that is automatically executed before the `main` function in a package.

---

## Overview

In Go, the `init` function is a special function that can be used to perform initialization tasks within a package. Each package can have multiple `init` functions, and they are executed automatically when the package is imported.

---

## Basic Syntax

The `init` function is declared without parameters and without a return value:

```go
func init() {
    // Initialization code
}
```

---

## Key Characteristics

1. **Automatic Execution**: `init` functions are automatically called by the Go runtime.
2. **Execution Order**: They are executed after all variable declarations in the package have been evaluated.
3. **Multiple `init` Functions**: A package can have multiple `init` functions, even within the same file.
4. **No Parameters or Return Values**: `init` functions cannot take parameters or return values.
5. **Cannot Be Called Explicitly**: `init` functions are called automatically by the Go runtime and cannot be called directly.

---

## Execution Order

The execution order of `init` functions follows these rules:

1. Within a single file, `init` functions are executed in the order they appear.
2. Across multiple files in the same package, the execution order is not guaranteed.
3. For multiple packages, `init` functions are executed in the order of package imports.

---

## Example

### Basic `init` Function

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Variable declaration
var message string

// init function
func init() {
    message = "Hello, World!"
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(message) // Output: Hello, World!
}
```

### Multiple `init` Functions in One File

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// First init function
func init() {
    fmt.Println("First init function")
}

// Second init function
func init() {
    fmt.Println("Second init function")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Main function")
}

// Output:
// First init function
// Second init function
// Main function
```

### `init` Functions Across Multiple Files

If you have multiple files in the same package, each with their own `init` functions, the execution order is not guaranteed.

#### file1.go
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func init() {
    fmt.Println("init from file1")
}
```

#### file2.go
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func init() {
    fmt.Println("init from file2")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Main function")
}
```

The output could be either:
```
init from file1
init from file2
Main function
```
or
```
init from file2
init from file1
Main function
```

---

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Initializing Package-Level Variables

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
    "time"
)

var randomNumbers []int

func init() {
    rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
    randomNumbers = make([]int, 5)
    for i := range randomNumbers {
        randomNumbers[i] = rand.Intn(100)
    }
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(randomNumbers)
}
```

### 2. Registering Drivers or Plugins

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // The underscore means we only want the init side effects
)

func init() {
    // This is just an example - the actual driver registration happens in the driver's init function
    fmt.Println("MySQL driver registered")
}

func main() {
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err.Error())
    }
    defer db.Close()
    
    fmt.Println("Database connection established")
}
```

### 3. One-Time Setup Operations

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

var configFile string

func init() {
    // Set default config file path
    configFile = "/etc/myapp/config.json"
    
    // Override with environment variable if set
    if envPath := os.Getenv("MYAPP_CONFIG"); envPath != "" {
        configFile = envPath
    }
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Using config file:", configFile)
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep `init` Functions Simple**: Avoid complex logic in `init` functions. They should be used for initialization tasks only.

2. **Avoid Dependencies Between Packages**: Be careful with dependencies between `init` functions in different packages, as the execution order is based on import order.

3. **Don't Rely on Execution Order**: If you have multiple `init` functions in the same package, don't rely on their execution order, especially across multiple files.

4. **Use `init` for Setup, Not for Business Logic**: `init` functions are meant for initialization, not for implementing business logic.

5. **Consider Explicit Initialization**: Sometimes it's better to have explicit initialization functions rather than using `init`, especially when the initialization might fail or when you need more control over when it happens.

---

## Conclusion

The `init` function is a special feature in Go that provides a way to perform initialization tasks automatically:

1. **Automatic Execution**: `init` functions are called automatically by the Go runtime.
2. **Initialization Tasks**: They are commonly used for initializing package-level variables, registering drivers, and performing one-time setup operations.
3. **No Parameters or Return Values**: `init` functions cannot take parameters or return values.
4. **Multiple `init` Functions**: A package can have multiple `init` functions, but their execution order across files is not guaranteed.

While `init` functions can be useful for certain initialization tasks, they should be used judiciously and kept simple. In many cases, explicit initialization functions may provide better control and clarity.
