# Go Init Functions

The **`init`** function is a special function in Go that runs **automatically** before the `main` function or any other code in the package is executed.

### 1. Basic Usage

You don't call `init()` yourself. Go calls it for you.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func init() {
    fmt.Println("Init: Running before main")
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Main: Starting now")
}
```

### 2. Execution Order

1.  **Variables**: All package-level variables are initialized first.
2.  **`init()` functions**: Then, all `init()` functions are called.
3.  **`main()` function**: Finally, the `main()` function is called.

### 3. Multiple Init Functions

You can have **multiple** `init()` functions in the same file or across multiple files in the same package. They will run in the order they appear.

```go
func init() {
    fmt.Println("First init")
}

func init() {
    fmt.Println("Second init")
}
```

### Why use `init()`?

-   **Variable setup**: Initializing complex global variables that can't be set with a simple assignment.
-   **Environment check**: Checking if necessary environment variables or configuration files are present.
-   **Registration**: Registering drivers (e.g., database drivers) or plugins.

### Best Practices

-   **Keep it simple**: Don't put heavy logic or long-running tasks in `init`. It can make your program hard to test and slow to start.
-   **Avoid side-effects**: Try to keep `init` functions focused only on setting up the internal state of the package.
