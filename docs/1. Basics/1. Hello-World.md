# Go: Hello World!
!!! abstract "Overview"
    We will write our first go program "Hello, World!".

!!! note "Prerequisites"
    Before starting, ensure you have:
    
    - Go installed on your system
    - A text editor or IDE
    - Basic understanding of using the terminal

## Checking Your Go Installation

First, verify that Go is properly installed on your system by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to this:

```bash title="Terminal Output"
#$ go version 
go1.25.1 X:nodwarf5 linux/amd64
```

!!! warning "Not Installed?"
    If you see a "command not found" error, you'll need to [download and install Go](https://golang.org/dl/) first.

If not, for now, you can visit <a href="https://go.dev/play/">Go Playground</a>

## Writing Your First Go Program

Let's create a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

**Assumption: You are using Linux, Mac, or WSL.**

=== "Step 1: Create File"

    Open a directory of your choice in your terminal and Create a new file named `hello.go` in your preferred directory. If you are on linux you can type `touch hello.go` in your terminal.

    ```bash
    cd /home/user/Downloads/program/ && touch hello.go
    ```

=== "Step 2: Add Code"

    Copy this code into your `hello.go` file:

    ```go title="hello.go" linenums="1" hl_lines="6"
    package main

    import "fmt"

    func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
    }
    ```


### Understanding the Code

Breakdown the code:

!!! info "Code Structure"
    === "Package Declaration"
        ```go
        package main
        ```
        
        - Every Go program starts with a package declaration
        - `main` package creates an executable program
        - Other packages create reusable libraries
        
    === "Import Statement"
        ```go
        import "fmt"
        ```
        
        - Imports the formatting package `fmt`. It Provides functions for i/o operation.
        - Essential for console interaction.
        
    === "Main Function"
        ```go
        func main() {
            fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
        }
        ```
        
        - Function declaration using `func` keyword.
        - Entry point of the program
        - `fmt.Println()` prints text and adds a newline
        - Program execution starts here

**Extra Jargon**: If you have noticed in the program, the line `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")`, you may wonder why the `Println` function is in all caps. This is because `Println` is a function from the `fmt` package that is used to print text to the console. The `fmt` package is part of the Go standard library and provides functions for formatted I/O. The `Println` function is one of the most commonly used functions in the `fmt` package. It stands for "Print Line" and is used to print text to the console with a newline at the end. The `Println` function is case-sensitive and must be written in all caps, that way the Go compiler knows that you are referring to the `Println` function from the `fmt` package.

## Running our Program

There are two ways to run your Go program.

=== "Method 1: Direct Execution"
    Use `go run` to compile and execute in one step:
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    go run hello.go
    ```

    ```bash title="Output"
    Hello, World!
    ```

    !!! tip "Quick Development"
        This method is perfect for development and testing as it's faster for quick iterations.

=== "Method 2: Build & Execute"
    First, compile the program:
    ```bash title="Terminal"
    go build hello.go
    ```

    Then run the executable:
    ```bash title="Terminal - Linux/macOS"
    ./hello
    ```
    ```bash title="Terminal - Windows"
    hello.exe
    ```

    !!! tip "Production Use"
        Second method, when we build the file, we are creating an executable file that we can distribute and run on any system without Go installed.

## Print Functions

Go provides several ways to output text. Here are some variations of our Hello World program:

!!! example "Print Variations"

    === "Using fmt.Printf"
        ```go title="hello.go" hl_lines="6"
        package main

        import "fmt"

        func main() {
            fmt.Printf("Hello, World!\n")  // Formatted print
        }
        ```
        
        !!! tip
            `Printf` allows formatted strings using placeholders like `%s`, `%d`, etc.

    === "Multiple Print Statements"
        ```go title="hello.go" hl_lines="6 7"
        package main

        import "fmt"

        func main() {
            fmt.Print("Hello, ")     // Prints without newline
            fmt.Println("World!")    // Prints with newline
        }
        ```
        
        !!! tip
            Combine `Print` and `Println` for flexible output formatting.
