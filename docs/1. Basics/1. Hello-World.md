# Go Hello World

Every Go program starts with a `main` package and a `main` function. This is the entry point of your application.

### Your First Program

Create a file named `hello.go`:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### How to Run it

You can run Go programs directly from your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Run directly (compiled and executed in memory)
go run hello.go

# 2. Build an executable
go build hello.go
./hello
```

### Understanding the Code

1.  **`package main`**: This tells the Go compiler that this file should compile as an executable program rather than a shared library.
2.  **`import "fmt"`**: We import the "fmt" (format) package from the standard library to use its `Println` function.
3.  **`func main()`**: This is the first function that runs when you start your program.
4.  **`fmt.Println()`**: Prints text to the console and adds a newline at the end. Note that exported functions in Go always start with a **Capital Letter**.

### The Go Playground

If you don't have Go installed locally yet, you can write and run Go code directly in your browser at [go.dev/play](https://go.dev/play).
