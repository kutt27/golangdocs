# Go Standard Library

One of Go's greatest strengths is its **Standard Library**. It is a collection of built-in packages that provide everything you need to build professional software without needing external dependencies.

### 1. Commonly Used Packages

| Package | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`fmt`** | Formatted I/O (Printing to console, reading user input). |
| **`strings`** | String manipulation (Searching, splitting, joining). |
| **`strconv`** | Converting strings to other types (and vice-versa). |
| **`math`** | Mathematical constants and functions. |
| **`os`** | Operating system functions (File I/O, environment variables). |
| **`net/http`** | Building HTTP clients and web servers. |
| **`encoding/json`** | Working with JSON data. |
| **`time`** | Measuring and displaying time. |

### 2. Importing Packages

You use the `import` keyword to bring packages into your code. It's best to use "factored" imports for multiple packages.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
    "net/http"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```

### 3. Import Aliases

You can give a package a custom name if there is a conflict or if you want it to be shorter.

```go
import f "fmt"

func main() {
    f.Println("Using an alias")
}
```

### 4. Side-effect Imports

Sometimes you want to import a package just for its **initialization** logic (like a database driver), but you don't use any of its functions. We use the blank identifier `_` for this.

```go
import _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
```

### Tips for Success

1.  **Standard Library First**: Always check if the standard library can do what you need before looking for a third-party library. It's usually faster, safer, and better documented.
2.  **Go Doc**: You can read documentation for any package from your terminal: `go doc fmt`.
3.  **Capitalization**: Remember, only functions that start with a **Capital Letter** (e.g., `fmt.Println`) are "exported" and can be used outside their package.
