04th Feb, 2026 => Project is much readable now and removed lot of jargon. 

Read -> Understand -> Open editor -> Write the code without looking -> Look the code -> Retry it from beginning -> Working? -> Mess around -> Work the other way? -> Try it -> Not working -> Google it (not AI) -> Find the problem -> Fix it -> Mess around -> Go on -> Why does it work like this? -> Ask google -> Understand -> Scratch the code -> Working? -> Maybe not? -> **Ask AI** -> Move to the next topic 

~~Thank you~~
Arigato!
